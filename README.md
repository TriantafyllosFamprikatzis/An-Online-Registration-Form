# TechDegree-Project-3
 
This project is a responsive, mobile-friendly registration form using a wide variety of HTML form input types and attributes.
Using the supplied mockup files with the freedom to make it look cooler, I have builed a mobile and desktop version of the form using media queries, and a "mobile-first" approach.
