## An-Online-Registration-Form
 
This project is a responsive, mobile-friendly registration form using a wide variety of HTML form input types and attributes.
Using the supplied mockup files with the freedom to change the design, I have builed a mobile and desktop version of the form using media queries, and a "mobile-first" approach.

## What I Learned

- Develop HTML **forms**.
- Implement CSS **transitions**.
